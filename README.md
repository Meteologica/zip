Go zip library
==============

This project is based on the [archive/zip](https://github.com/golang/go/tree/master/src/archive/zip) Go standard library to add a `Updater` struct to allow appending new files to the existing zip archive without decompress the whole file.

> **Not stable to use in production yet!**
